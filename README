0. What is that?

   PyJIRA is a python library for accessing Atlassian JIRA remote API.
   
   It is based on my earlier project - cojira, the commandline interface for
   JIRA. I'm planning to rewrite cojira to use PyJIRA library in the nearest
   future.

1. Compatibility

   PyJIRA needs at least jira-4.0. It won't work with jira-3, because it uses
   getProjectsNoSchemes API call which was added in 4.0 release. I'm not
   planning to support older JIRA versions. If you need to hack it to work
   with older JIRA, take a look at cojira project, how to list projects list
   without getProjectsNoSchemes function.

2. How to use it?

   It is in very early stage of development and is not functional yet.

   If you want to play with PyJIRA, export following enviromental variables: 
   JIRA_URL      - base JIRA url without trailing slash
   JIRA_USERNAME - name of JIRA account
   JIRA_PASSWORD - hmmm, I realy don't know what is the purpose of this one
   and run ./test.py
