1. Important TODOs:
* Learn how to write pythonic installation scripts and write one for PyJIRA.
* Translate my pseudo-english to real english.

2. Some Ideas:
* soap.py:
  generate methodes that overload all jira API calls and pass self.token to
  them. These wrappers may also str() all arguments, so these calls will
  accept JiraObject arguments.
